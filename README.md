**1. Statement of the Problem**

The 1D protein sequence contains information about amino acid residues, but not about essential topological information. On the other hand, 3D structure gives topological annotation and visualization of domain interactions but lacks amino acid residue information and is difficult to comprehend biological function. 1D representation maps contain both sequence information and 3D domain assembly, allowing biologists to grasp residue connections and, ultimately, function.

**2. Why is it significant?**

The immune system relies heavily on Ig domains. They detect foreign antigens, bind the receptor binding domain (RBD), and eliminate antigens from the biological system. IgV domains are especially essential because of the variable region's capacity to bind novel antigens and RBDs. Visualizing domain folds and RBD binding in 1D maps will reveal areas with insertions and/or mutations that impede the immune system from identifying pathogens. 1D maps will be used to discover novel treatment targets.

**3. Objectives**

**Visualization of 1D maps:** construct a 1D map of Ig domains that non-experts can comprehend.

**Superimpose Residue Information on 1D Map:** Use 3D annotation to produce a vector representation of residue features and include them into the 1D map. For example, bold residues indicate whether the structure is oriented in or out.

**Generate 1D maps for domains that have no preceding 3D annotation:** Employing machine learning, identify the main traits in order to construct innovative 1D maps from sequence data.
